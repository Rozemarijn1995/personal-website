My name is Rozemarijn van Dijk and I am currently a PhD-researcher and teaching assistant at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. Besides being an academic, I am a big fan of bird watching, discovering (and more importantly, eating) cheeses, listening to podcasts and reading books. On this website I will give you a quick overview of my research and several outreach activities.  

In 2013 I started as a student in the bachelor program Political Science at Leiden University, where I graduated cum laude. During the bachelor I did an internship at the The Netherlands [Institute for Social Research](https://english.scp.nl/). During this internship I discovered that doing social research was my passion. Therefore, I enrolled in the research master Political Science and Public Administration in 2016. In 2019 I obtained my master degree (cum laude). Currently I am doing my PhD at the University of Antwerp, under supervision of [Prof. dr. P. Meier](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/petra-meier/) and [Prof. dr. J. J. M. Van Holsteyn](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/joop-van-holsteijn#tab-1).

Besides doing my PhD, I am also a teaching assistant. Apart from providing assistance to professors in the organization of their courses, I regularly give guest lectures and teach courses. In 2020-2021 I supervised a bachelor thesis class on gender and lobbying. Since 2019 I teach a seminar about affective polarization in the master Political Communication. 

Since social sciences is broader than publishing academic papers, I try to translate research to society as well. I do this by writing blogs and opinion articles, which you can read [here](/blogs). Together with a colleague I also started a [podcast](/content/home/podcast) about research that is conducted in our research group. You can listen to the podcast (in Dutch) on several podcast players, such as [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5Zcl08yq5dCD9lnIjATF5x?si=3c4326e136ba4e8a).
