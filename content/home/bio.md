I am a Phd-student and teaching assistant at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. 

In 2013 I enrolled in the bachelor program Political Science at Leiden University. In 2016 I started the research master Political Science and Public Administration, and in 2019 I obtained my master degree (cum laude). Currently I am doing my doctoral training at the University of Antwerp, under supervision of Prof. dr. P. Meier and Prof. dr. J. J. M. Van Holsteyn.

Besides doing my PhD, I am also a teaching assistant. Apart from providing assistance to professors in the organization of their courses, I regularly give guest lectures and teach courses. In 2020-2021 I supervised a bachelor thesis class on gender and lobbying. Since 2019 I teach a seminar about affective polarization in the master Political Communication. 

Since social sciences is broader than publishing academic papers, I try to ‘translate’ research to society as well. I do this by writing blogs and opinion articles. Together with a colleague I also started a podcast about research that is conducted in our research group. You can listen to the podcast (in Dutch) on several podcast players, such as [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5Zcl08yq5dCD9lnIjATF5x?si=3c4326e136ba4e8a).
