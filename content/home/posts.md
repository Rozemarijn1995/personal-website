Together with my colleague [Samira Azabar](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/samira-azabar/), I produce the Dutch podcast Politicologica. In this podcast we speak with colleagues from our department about their research. We want to show that social science research is more than publishing academic papers and that  research can help everyone understand how politics works. You can find the show on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5Zcl08yq5dCD9lnIjATF5x?si=0b3efd3db92943fc), [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-299897290) and [Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/be/podcast/podcast-politicologica/id1570392842). Soon you can download  the .mp3 files and the (Dutch) show notes of the episodes on this website too. In case you have any questions about the podcast, feel free contact us on politicologica@gmail.com.
