## INTRAPARTY project
As a postdoctoral researcher, I work in the [INTRAPARTY project](https://www.gu.se/en/research/the-benefits-of-conflict-how-factions-can-enhance-political-parties-electoral-performance-intraparty) of [Ann-Kristin Kölln](https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/ann-kristinkolln). I focus on how groups within a political party try to influence the party’s main agenda. What influence strategies do they use? Do they opt for an internal strategy by using internal channels such as party conferences, or do they try to shape the agenda indirectly by being outspoken in the media? Within this project, I pay particular attention to the role of women’s organizations in political parties over time: what issues have they been lobbying for in past decades, and how have their priorities changed?  

## Dissertation project
My dissertation project was inspired by the puzzle of the underrepresentation of women in parliament. I examined both the demand side of political recruitment (how parties select candidates) and the supply side (the development of political ambition). What rules do parties use to select candidates, and how do these rules affect who gets selected? Is there a gender gap in political ambition among party members? Do inclusive versus exclusive selectorates produce different candidate lists? By addressing these questions, my dissertation provides insight into the interaction of supply and demand in political recruitment, and how this process is gendered. You can read my PhD thesis [here](https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docstore/d:irua:28328).  

## Other projects
Beyond my dissertation, I am involved in several other research projects. These include work on:  
- designing electoral systems for gender parity (with Petra Meier and Petra Ahrens) 
- candidate selection in the UK (with Chris Butler, Marta Miori and Rob Ford)  
- the role of LGBTQ+ wings in political parties (with Michal Grahn and Sofia Ammassari), and  
- [(gendered) violence against politicians](https://osf.io/86nwu) (with Joep van Lit).
