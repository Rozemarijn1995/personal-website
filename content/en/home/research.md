## Dissertation project
My dissertation project was inspired by the puzzle of the underrepresentation of women in parliament. I focused on how political parties select candidates (the demand side of political recruitment) and on the formation of political ambition (the supply side). What rules do parties use to select candidates and how this affect which candidates they select? Is there a gender gap in political ambition among party members? Do inclusive and exclusive selectorates create different candidate lists? By answering these questions I tried to get a grasp on both the supply and demand of political candidates and to examine whether this is gendered.

## Other projects
Apart from my dissertation project, I am involved in a couple of other research projects. These projects are about gender quota; candidate selection in the UK (together with Chris Butler); LGBT wings in political parties (together with Michal Grahn and Sofia Ammassari); gendered parliamentary behavior (together with Zeljko Poljak); and (gendered) violence against politicians (together with Joep van Lit).
