## Dissertation project
My dissertation project is inspired by the puzzle of the underrepresentation of women in parliament. In my research I focus on how political parties select candidates and on the individual recruitment chain. What rules do parties use to select candidates and how this affect which candidates they select? Is there a gender gap in political ambition among party members? Do inclusive and exclusive selectorates create different candidate lists? By answering these questions I try to get a grasp on both the supply and demand of political candidates and to examine whether this is gendered.

## Other projects
Apart from my dissertation project, I am involved in a couple of other research projects. These projects are about gender quota; candidate selection in the UK (together with Chris Butler); LGBT wings in political parties (together with Michal Grahn and Sofia Ammassari); gendered parliamentary behavior (together with Zeljko Poljak); and (gendered) violence against politicians (together with Joep van Lit).
