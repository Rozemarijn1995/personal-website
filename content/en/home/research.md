## Dissertation project
My dissertation project is inspired by the puzzle of the underrepresentation of women in parliament. In my research I focus on the recruitment chain: how do politicians get selected? This is of crucial importance, since already on the ballot paper women are underrepresented. In different papers I try to study the candidate selection procedure from different angles: e.g., who are the people that select candidates? What kind of preferences do they have for the ideal candidate list? But I will also look at the other side: the candidates. Which party members are more likely to run for office? 

By investigating these questions, I will contribute to answering the question of why there still is no equal gender representation in parliament. 

## Other projects
Apart from my dissertation project, I am involved in a couple of other research projects. These projects are about affective polarization, gender quota, and gender diversity in the media.
