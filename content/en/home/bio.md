My name is Rozemarijn van Dijk and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. Besides being an academic, I am a big fan of bird watching, discovering (and more importantly, eating) cheese, listening to podcasts, and reading books. On this website, I offer a brief overview of my research and various other activities.

I began studying Political Science in 2013 at Leiden University, where I completed my bachelor's degree <em>cum laude</em>. During my studies, I interned at the [Netherlands Institute for Social Research](https://english.scp.nl/), where I discovered my passion for social research. This led me to enroll in the Research Master's program in Political Science and Public Administration in 2016. I obtained my Masterâ€™s degree cum laude in 2019 and went on to pursue a PhD at the University of Antwerp. My dissertation, titled [From Admission to Admission. The Recruitment of Women in Politics](https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/676ae5motoMbe) was supervised by [prof. dr. Petra Meier](https://www.uantwerpen.be/nl/personeel/petra-meier/) and [prof. dr. Joop van Holsteyn](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/medewerkers/joop-van-holsteijn#tab-1).

My research focuses on the underrepresentation of women in politics, with a specific focus on the role of political parties. My other research interests are political violence and its (gendered) effects on political participation; gender quotas; LGBTQ+ party wings. 

Since social science research goes beyond academic publishing, I also engage with broader audiences by writing blogs and opinion pieces to share insights from my work.
